# Eco-Friendly Biodegradable Plastic Research and Development
This GitHub contains all relevant files used during/created after a research project regarding biodegradable plastics.
## Project Members
Teagan Tobias â€“ High School Senior at time (Girls Preparatory School, Chattanooga)
## Project Summary
This Project focuses on the research and development of biodegradable plastic materials as a sustainable alternative to conventional plastics. Diven by an urgent need to address the escalating plastic pollution crisis, this initiative aims to create eco-friendly materials that degrade naturally in the environemnt, specifically aquatic environments, without leaving harmful residues. This task was fully student led with minimal funding from the school and other institutes. This task was aided by the Tennessee Aquarium in Chattanooga, Tennessee. This project uses Chemical Engineering, Materials Science/Engineering, and Environmental Science/Engineering.
## Project Capabilities and Goals
- Create small-scale bioplastics with cheap, easily-accessible materials
- Test variables of development (heat time, dry time, flexibility, etc.) and test biodegradability
- Utilize local resources and environments
- Understand science behind bioplastics and polymer chemistry
- Compare different bioplastic prototypes
## Materials Used
- See attached documents
