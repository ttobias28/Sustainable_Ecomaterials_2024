## Project Summary
Marine environments (and others) are in danger due to human activities, one of which being plastic pollution. Eight million tons of plastic end up in the ocean every single year and is the largest threat to marine life. These plastics release harmful chemicals, affecting oxygen levels and acidity, as well as damaging habitats like coral reefs and underwater meadows. As long as we're harming the ocean, we are harming ourselves, too. The plastic we throw into the ocean doesn't disappear –– it returns to our plates as toxins in the food we eat. Responsibility isn't optional.

This Project focuses on the research and development of biodegradable plastic materials as a sustainable alternative to conventional plastics. Driven by an urgent need to address the escalating plastic pollution crisis, this initiative aims to create eco-friendly plastics that degrade naturally in the environemnt, specifically aquatic environments, without leaving harmful residues. This task was fully student led with minimal funding/assistance from the school and other institutes. This task was aided by the Tennessee Aquarium in Chattanooga, Tennessee. This project uses Chemical Engineering, Materials Science/Engineering, and Environmental Science/Engineering.
## Project Capabilities and Goals
- Create small-scale bioplastics with cheap, easily-accessible materials
- Test variables of development (heat time, dry time, flexibility, etc.) and test biodegradability
- Utilize local resources and environments
- Understand science behind bioplastics and polymer chemistry
- Compare different bioplastic prototypes
## Materials Used
